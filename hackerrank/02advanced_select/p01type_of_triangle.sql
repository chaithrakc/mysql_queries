Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:
+--------+---------+
| Column |  Type   |
+--------+---------+
| A      | Integer |
| B      | Integer |
| C      | Integer |
+--------+---------+

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.
Sample Input
+----+----+----+
| A  | B  | C  |
+----+----+----+
| 20 | 20 | 23 |
| 20 | 20 | 20 |
| 20 | 21 | 22 |
| 13 | 14 | 30 |
+----+----+----+

Sample Output
Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle

Explanation
Values in the tuple (20,20,23) form an Isosceles triangle, because A=B.
Values in the tuple (20,20,20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A=B=C. 
Values in the tuple (20,21,22) form a Scalene triangle, because A != B != C.
Values in the tuple (13,14,30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.
